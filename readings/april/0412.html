                            <h5>Deuteronomy 23</h5><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury:</p><p class="fnb"><span>20</span> Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it.</p><p class="fnb"><span>21</span> When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>22</span> But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>23</span> That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; even a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the LORD thy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>24</span> When thou comest into thy neighbour’s vineyard, then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel.</p><p class="fnb"><span>25</span> When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour, then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour’s standing corn.</p><h5>Deuteronomy 24</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man’s wife.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife;</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he taketh a man’s life to pledge.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye were come forth out of Egypt.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates:</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the fatherless; nor take a widow’s raiment to pledge:</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.</p><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands.</p><p class="fnb"><span>20</span> When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</p><p class="fnb"><span>21</span> When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</p><p class="fnb"><span>22</span> And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.</p><h5>Deuteronomy 25</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should seem vile unto thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband’s brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband’s brother unto her.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name be not put out of Israel.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> And if the man like not to take his brother’s wife, then let his brother’s wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband’s brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband’s brother.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Then shall his brother’s wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother’s house.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets:</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity her.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a small.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto the LORD thy God.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt;</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God.</p><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it.</p><h5>Deuteronomy 26</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest therein;</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name there.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God, that I am come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for to give us.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage:</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour, and our oppression:</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders:</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land, which thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God:</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the Levite, and the stranger that is among you.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled;</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them:</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for the dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, and have done according to all that thou hast commanded me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.</p>

                            <h5>Psalms 49</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Both low and high, rich and poor, together.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.</p><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.</p><p class="fnb"><span>20</span> Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.</p><h5>Psalms 50</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.</p><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.</p><p class="fnb"><span>20</span> Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother’s son.</p><p class="fnb"><span>21</span> These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.</p><p class="fnb"><span>22</span> Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</p><p class="fnb"><span>23</span> Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.</p>

                            <h2>Nehemiah 13-Esther 2:18</h2>
                            
                            <h5>Nehemiah 13</h5>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16</span> There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18</span> Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19</span> And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20</span> So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21</span> Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22</span> And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>23</span> In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>24</span> And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>25</span> And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>26</span> Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>27</span> Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>28</span> And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>29</span> Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>30</span> Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>31</span> And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.</p>
                            
                            <h5>Esther 1</h5>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16</span> And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18</span> Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19</span> If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20</span> And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21</span> And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22</span> For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.</p>
                            
                            <h5>Esther 2:1-18</h5>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16</span> So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18</span> Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.</p>

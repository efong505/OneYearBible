                            <h5>Psalms 102</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.</p><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;</p><p class="fnb"><span>20</span> To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;</p><p class="fnb"><span>21</span> To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;</p><p class="fnb"><span>22</span> When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.</p><p class="fnb"><span>23</span> He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.</p><p class="fnb"><span>24</span> I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.</p><p class="fnb"><span>25</span> Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.</p><p class="fnb"><span>26</span> They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:</p><p class="fnb"><span>27</span> But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.</p><p class="fnb"><span>28</span> The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.</p><h5>Psalms 103</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children’s children;</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.</p><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.</p><p class="fnb"><span>20</span> Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.</p><p class="fnb"><span>21</span> Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.</p><p class="fnb"><span>22</span> Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.</p>

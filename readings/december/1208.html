                            <h2>Daniel 3:19-5:12</h2>
                            <h5>Daniel 3</h5><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</p><p class="fnb"><span>20</span> And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</p><p class="fnb"><span>21</span> Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</p><p class="fnb"><span>22</span> Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</p><p class="fnb"><span>23</span> And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</p><p class="fnb"><span>24</span> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.</p><p class="fnb"><span>25</span> He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</p><p class="fnb"><span>26</span> Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.</p><p class="fnb"><span>27</span> And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</p><p class="fnb"><span>28</span> Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</p><p class="fnb"><span>29</span> Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.</p><p class="fnb"><span>30</span> Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.</p><h5>Daniel 4</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace:</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying,</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.</p><p class="fnb"><span>20</span> The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;</p><p class="fnb"><span>21</span> Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:</p><p class="fnb"><span>22</span> It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>23</span> And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;</p><p class="fnb"><span>24</span> This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:</p><p class="fnb"><span>25</span> That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</p><p class="fnb"><span>26</span> And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.</p><p class="fnb"><span>27</span> Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.</p><p class="fnb"><span>28</span> All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p class="fnb"><span>29</span> At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.</p><p class="fnb"><span>30</span> The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?</p><p class="fnb"><span>31</span> While the word was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>32</span> And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</p><p class="fnb"><span>33</span> The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws.</p><p class="fnb"><span>34</span> And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:</p><p class="fnb"><span>35</span> And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?</p><p class="fnb"><span>36</span> At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>37</span> Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.</p><h5>Daniel 5</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king’s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Then the king’s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Then came in all the king’s wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.</p>

                            <h2>Revelation 6</h2>
                            <h5>Revelation 6</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?</p>

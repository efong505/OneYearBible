I have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.</p>

                            <h5>Joel 1</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD’s ministers, mourn.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God?</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.</p><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.</p><p class="fnb"><span>20</span> The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.</p><h5>Joel 2</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand;</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks:</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God?</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?</p>

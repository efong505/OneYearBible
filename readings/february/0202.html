or who is a rock save our God?</p><p class="fnb"><span>32</span> It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.</p><p class="fnb"><span>33</span> He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet, and setteth me upon my high places.</p><p class="fnb"><span>34</span> He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</p><p class="fnb"><span>35</span> Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.</p><p class="fnb"><span>36</span> Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</p><p class="fnb"><span>37</span> I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</p><p class="fnb"><span>38</span> I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</p><p class="fnb"><span>39</span> For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>40</span> Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>41</span> They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</p><p class="fnb"><span>42</span> Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</p><p class="fnb"><span>43</span> Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>44</span> As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>45</span> The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.</p><p class="fnb"><span>46</span> The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</p><p class="fnb"><span>47</span> It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>48</span> He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</p><p class="fnb"><span>49</span> Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.</p><p class="fnb"><span>50</span> Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.</p>

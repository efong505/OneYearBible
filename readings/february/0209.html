In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.</p><h5>Psalms 20</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.</p><h5>Psalms 21</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Thou hast given him his heart’s desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power.</p>

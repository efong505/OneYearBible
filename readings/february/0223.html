him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses.</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.</p><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.</p><p class="fnb"><span>20</span> O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>21</span> Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>22</span> Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.</p><h5>Psalms 26</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD:</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.</p><h5>Psalms 27</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.</p>

                            <h5>Psalms 1</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.</p><h5>Psalms 2</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</p><h5>Psalms 3</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.</p><h5>Psalms 4</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.</p><h5>Psalms 5</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.</p>

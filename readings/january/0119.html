he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.</p><h5>Psalms 11</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD’s throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.</p><h5>Psalms 12</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.</p><h5>Psalms 13</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.</p>

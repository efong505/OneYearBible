Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</p>

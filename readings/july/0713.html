Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.</p><h5>Psalms 83</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.</p><h5>Psalms 84</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.</p><h5>Psalms 85</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps.</p>

Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.</p><h5>Psalms 76</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.</p><h5>Psalms 77</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.</p><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.</p><p class="fnb"><span>20</span> Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</p>

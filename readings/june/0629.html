                            <h5>Psalms 78</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</p><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</p><p class="fnb"><span>20</span> Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</p><p class="fnb"><span>21</span> Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</p><p class="fnb"><span>22</span> Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</p><p class="fnb"><span>23</span> Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</p><p class="fnb"><span>24</span> And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</p><p class="fnb"><span>25</span> Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.</p><p class="fnb"><span>26</span> He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</p><p class="fnb"><span>27</span> He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</p><p class="fnb"><span>28</span> And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</p><p class="fnb"><span>29</span> So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</p><p class="fnb"><span>30</span> They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,</p><p class="fnb"><span>31</span> The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.</p><p class="fnb"><span>32</span> For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</p><p class="fnb"><span>33</span> Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</p><p class="fnb"><span>34</span> When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.</p><p class="fnb"><span>35</span> And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</p><p class="fnb"><span>36</span> Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</p><p class="fnb"><span>37</span> For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</p><p class="fnb"><span>38</span> But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</p><p class="fnb"><span>39</span> For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</p><p class="fnb"><span>40</span> How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!</p><p class="fnb"><span>41</span> Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</p><p class="fnb"><span>42</span> They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</p><p class="fnb"><span>43</span> How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:</p><p class="fnb"><span>44</span> And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</p><p class="fnb"><span>45</span> He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</p><p class="fnb"><span>46</span> He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</p><p class="fnb"><span>47</span> He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</p><p class="fnb"><span>48</span> He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</p><p class="fnb"><span>49</span> He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.</p><p class="fnb"><span>50</span> He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</p><p class="fnb"><span>51</span> And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</p><p class="fnb"><span>52</span> But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p><p class="fnb"><span>53</span> And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p><p class="fnb"><span>54</span> And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</p><p class="fnb"><span>55</span> He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p><p class="fnb"><span>56</span> Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</p><p class="fnb"><span>57</span> But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p><p class="fnb"><span>58</span> For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</p><p class="fnb"><span>59</span> When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</p><p class="fnb"><span>60</span> So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;</p><p class="fnb"><span>61</span> And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.</p><p class="fnb"><span>62</span> He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</p><p class="fnb"><span>63</span> The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</p><p class="fnb"><span>64</span> Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</p><p class="fnb"><span>65</span> Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</p><p class="fnb"><span>66</span> And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</p><p class="fnb"><span>67</span> Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</p><p class="fnb"><span>68</span> But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</p><p class="fnb"><span>69</span> And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</p><p class="fnb"><span>70</span> He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</p><p class="fnb"><span>71</span> From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</p><p class="fnb"><span>72</span> So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</p>

Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.</p><h5>Psalms 31</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name’s sake lead me, and guide me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies’ sake.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.</p><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!</p><p class="fnb"><span>20</span> Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.</p><p class="fnb"><span>21</span> Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.</p><p class="fnb"><span>22</span> For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>23</span> O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.</p><p class="fnb"><span>24</span> Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.</p>

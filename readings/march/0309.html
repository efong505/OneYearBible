                            <h5>Psalms 32</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.</p><h5>Psalms 33</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;</p><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.</p><p class="fnb"><span>20</span> Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.</p><p class="fnb"><span>21</span> For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.</p><p class="fnb"><span>22</span> Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.</p><h5>Psalms 34</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.</p><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.</p><p class="fnb"><span>20</span> He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.</p><p class="fnb"><span>21</span> Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.</p><p class="fnb"><span>22</span> The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.</p>

Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:</p><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.</p><p class="fnb"><span>20</span> Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.</p><h5>Psalms 67</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.</p>

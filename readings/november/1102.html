                            <p class="fnb"><span>89</span> For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>90</span> Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast
                                established the earth, and it abideth.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>91</span> They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all
                                are thy servants.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>92</span> Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have
                                perished in mine affliction.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>93</span> I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast
                                quickened me.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>94</span> I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>95</span> The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will
                                consider thy testimonies.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>96</span> I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is
                                exceeding broad.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>97</span> O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>98</span> Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine
                                enemies: for they are ever with me.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>99</span> I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy
                                testimonies are my meditation.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>100</span> I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy
                                precepts.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>101</span> I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might
                                keep thy word.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>102</span> I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught
                                me.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>103</span> How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than
                                honey to my mouth!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>104</span> Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate
                                every false way.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>105</span> Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>106</span> I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy
                                righteous judgments.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>107</span> I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto
                                thy word.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>108</span> Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth,
                                O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>109</span> My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy
                                law.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>110</span> The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from
                                thy precepts.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>111</span> Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for
                                they are the rejoicing of my heart.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>112</span> I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway,
                                even unto the end.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>113</span> I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>114</span> Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>115</span> Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the
                                commandments of my God.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>116</span> Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let
                                me not be ashamed of my hope.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>117</span> Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have
                                respect unto thy statutes continually.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>118</span> Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes:
                                for their deceit is falsehood.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>119</span> Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross:
                                therefore I love thy testimonies.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>120</span> My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy
                                judgments.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>121</span> I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine
                                oppressors.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>122</span> Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud
                                oppress me.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>123</span> Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy
                                righteousness.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>124</span> Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me
                                thy statutes.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>125</span> I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy
                                testimonies.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>126</span> It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void
                                thy law.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>127</span> Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above
                                fine gold.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>128</span> Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to
                                be right; and I hate every false way.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>129</span> Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep
                                them.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>130</span> The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth
                                understanding unto the simple.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>131</span> I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy
                                commandments.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>132</span> Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to
                                do unto those that love thy name.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>133</span> Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have
                                dominion over me.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>134</span> Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy
                                precepts.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>135</span> Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy
                                statutes.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>136</span> Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not

                                enemy are deceitful.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul
                                every bitter thing is sweet.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that
                                wandereth from his place.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness
                                of a man’s friend by hearty counsel.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not;
                                neither go into thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a
                                neighbour that is near than a brother far off.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer
                                him that reproacheth me.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the
                                simple pass on, and are punished.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a
                                pledge of him for a strange woman.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early
                                in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious
                                woman are alike.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16</span> Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his
                                right hand, which bewrayeth itself.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of
                                his friend.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18</span> Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he
                                that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19</span> As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to
                                man.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20</span> Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are
                                never satisfied.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21</span> As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is
                                a man to his praise.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22</span> Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat
                                with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.</p>

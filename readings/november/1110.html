                            <h2>Jeremiah 52:24- Lamentations 2:22</h2>
                            <h5>Jeremiah 52:24-24</h5>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>24</span> And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest,
                                and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>25</span> He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge
                                of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king’s person, which were
                                found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the
                                land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the
                                city.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>26</span> So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and
                                brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>27</span> And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in
                                Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>28</span> This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive:
                                in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>29</span> In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away
                                captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>30</span> In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan
                                the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five
                                persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>31</span> And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
                                captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth
                                day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign
                                lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>32</span> And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the
                                throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>33</span> And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat
                                bread before him all the days of his life.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>34</span> And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the
                                king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his
                                life.</p>
                            <h5>Lamentations 1</h5>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a
                                widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she
                                become tributary!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers
                                she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are
                                become her enemies.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and consider; for I am become vile.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the LORD hath delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> The LORD hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the LORD hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16</span> For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18</span> The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19</span> I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20</span> Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21</span> They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22</span> Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.</p>
                            <h5>Lamentations 2:1-22</h5>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in
                                his anger, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered
                                not his footstool in the day of his anger!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> The LORD hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and
                                hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of
                                Judah; he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the
                                princes thereof.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he
                                hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a
                                flaming fire, which devoureth round about.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right
                                hand as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of
                                the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath
                                swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in
                                the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were
                                of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the
                                solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation
                                of his anger the king and the priest.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> The LORD hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his
                                sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they
                                have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of
                                Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying:
                                therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and
                                broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more;
                                her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and
                                keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with
                                sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my
                                liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people;
                                because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they
                                swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into
                                their mothers’ bosom.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall
                                I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort
                                thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal
                                thee?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and
                                they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for
                                thee false burdens and causes of banishment.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag
                                their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men call The
                                perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16</span> All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they
                                hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up: certainly this is the day
                                that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath
                                fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and
                                hath not pitied: and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the
                                horn of thine adversaries.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18</span> Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wall of the daughter of
                                Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the
                                apple of thine eye cease.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19</span> Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches
                                pour out thine heart like water before the face of the LORD: lift up thy hands toward
                                him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every
                                street.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20</span> Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this.
                                Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? shall the priest and the
                                prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21</span> The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my
                                virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day of
                                thine anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22</span> Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about,
                                so that in the day of the LORD’s anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have
                                swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.</p>

                            <h2>1 Peter 2</h2>
                            <h5>1 Peter 2</h5>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and
                                hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye
                                may grow thereby:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of
                                men, but chosen of God, and precious,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an
                                holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay
                                in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be
                                confounded.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them
                                which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head
                                of the corner,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them
                                which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
                                nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called
                                you out of darkness into his marvellous light:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people
                                of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims,
                                abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that,
                                whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they
                                shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s
                                sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the
                                punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to
                                silence the ignorance of foolish men:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16</span> As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of
                                maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the
                                king.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18</span> Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only
                                to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19</span> For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God
                                endure grief, suffering wrongfully.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20</span> For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your
                                faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take
                                it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21</span> For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also
                                suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22</span> Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>23</span> Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he
                                suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>24</span> Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree,
                                that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were
                                healed.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>25</span> For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto
                                the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</p>

                            <h5>Psalms 127</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.</p><h5>Psalms 128</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Yea, thou shalt see thy children’s children, and peace upon Israel.</p><h5>Psalms 129</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.</p><h5>Psalms 130</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.</p><h5>Psalms 131</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.</p><h5>Psalms 132</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> For thy servant David’s sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.</p>

                            <h5>Isaiah 52</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day is blasphemed.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rereward.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.</p><h5>Isaiah 53</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</p><h5>Isaiah 54</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great shall be the peace of thy children.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.</p><h5>Isaiah 55</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near:</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.</p><h5>Isaiah 56</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant;</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> The Lord GOD, which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.</p>

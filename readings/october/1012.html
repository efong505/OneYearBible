Praise the LORD.</p><h5>Psalms 116</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> I said in my haste, All men are liars.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me?</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people,</p><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> In the courts of the LORD’s house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.</p><h5>Psalms 117</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> O Praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD.</p><h5>Psalms 118</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and set me in a large place.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.</p><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD:</p><p class="fnb"><span>20</span> This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.</p><p class="fnb"><span>21</span> I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.</p><p class="fnb"><span>22</span> The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.</p><p class="fnb"><span>23</span> This is the LORD’s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.</p><p class="fnb"><span>24</span> This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.</p><p class="fnb"><span>25</span> Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.</p><p class="fnb"><span>26</span> Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.</p><p class="fnb"><span>27</span> God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.</p><p class="fnb"><span>28</span> Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>29</span> O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>

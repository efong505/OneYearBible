                            <h5>Isaiah 56</h5><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts in the forest.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant.</p><h5>Isaiah 57</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks?</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion; they, they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these?</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase thyself even unto hell.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.</p><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him.</p><p class="fnb"><span>20</span> But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.</p><p class="fnb"><span>21</span> There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.</p><h5>Isaiah 58</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noon day:</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.</p><h5>Isaiah 59</h5><p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Behold, the LORD’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:</p><p class="fnb"><span>2</span> But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.</p><p class="fnb"><span>3</span> For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness.</p><p class="fnb"><span>4</span> None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.</p><p class="fnb"><span>5</span> They hatch cockatrice’ eggs, and weave the spider’s web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.</p><p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.</p><p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths.</p><p class="fnb"><span>8</span> The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace.</p><p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.</p><p class="fnb"><span>10</span> We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men.</p><p class="fnb"><span>11</span> We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.</p><p class="fnb"><span>12</span> For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them;</p><p class="fnb"><span>13</span> In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.</p><p class="fnb"><span>14</span> And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.</p><p class="fnb"><span>15</span> Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.</p><p class="fnb"><span>16</span> And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.</p><p class="fnb"><span>17</span> For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.</p><p class="fnb"><span>18</span> According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence.</p><p class="fnb"><span>19</span> So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.</p><p class="fnb"><span>20</span> And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.</p><p class="fnb"><span>21</span> As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.</p>

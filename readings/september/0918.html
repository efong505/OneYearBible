                            <h2>Ecclesiastes 7:13 - 10:7</h2>
                            <h5>Ecclesiastes 7:13-29</h5>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight,
                                which he hath made crooked?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of
                                adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that
                                man should find nothing after him.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a
                                just man that
                                perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in
                                his wickedness.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16</span> Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise:
                                why shouldest
                                thou destroy thyself?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why
                                shouldest thou die
                                before thy time?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18</span> It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also
                                from this
                                withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19</span> Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which
                                are in the
                                city.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20</span> For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and
                                sinneth not.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21</span> Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou
                                hear thy
                                servant curse thee:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22</span> For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself
                                likewise
                                hast cursed others.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>23</span> All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but
                                it was far
                                from me.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>24</span> That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it
                                out?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>25</span> I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out
                                wisdom, and
                                the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and
                                madness:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>26</span> And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is
                                snares and
                                nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner
                                shall be taken by her.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>27</span> Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one
                                by one, to
                                find out the account:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>28</span> Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a
                                thousand have I
                                found; but a woman among all those have I not found.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>29</span> Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright;
                                but they have sought out many
                                inventions.</p>


                            <h5>Ecclesiastes 8</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of
                                a thing? a man's wisdom
                                maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in
                                regard of the oath of God.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil
                                thing; for he doeth whatsoever
                                pleaseth him.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say
                                unto him, What doest thou?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a
                                wise man's heart discerneth
                                both time and judgment.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore
                                the misery of man is great
                                upon him.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him
                                when it shall be?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the
                                spirit; neither hath he
                                power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall
                                wickedness
                                deliver those that are given to it.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work
                                that is done under the sun:
                                there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from
                                the place of the holy, and
                                they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Because sentence against an evil work is not executed
                                speedily, therefore the heart of
                                the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be
                                prolonged, yet surely I know
                                that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he
                                prolong his days, which are as
                                a shadow; because he feareth not before God.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be
                                just men, unto whom it
                                happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it
                                happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing
                                under the sun, than to eat,
                                and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of
                                his
                                life, which God giveth him under the sun.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16</span> When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the
                                business that is done upon the
                                earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out
                                the work that is done under
                                the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea
                                further;
                                though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.</p>

                            <h5>Ecclesiastes 9</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all
                                this, that the righteous, and
                                the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred
                                by
                                all that is before them.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> All things come alike to all: there is one event to the
                                righteous, and to the wicked; to
                                the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that
                                sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that
                                feareth
                                an oath.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun,
                                that there is one event unto
                                all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their
                                heart
                                while they live, and after that they go to the dead.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for
                                a living dog is better than
                                a dead lion.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not
                                any thing, neither have
                                they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now
                                perished; neither have they any
                                more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a
                                merry heart; for God now
                                accepteth thy works.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no
                                ointment.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of
                                the life of thy vanity, which
                                he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in
                                this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for
                                there is no work, nor
                                device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to
                                the swift, nor the battle to
                                the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor
                                yet
                                favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are
                                taken in an evil net, and as
                                the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time,
                                when
                                it falleth suddenly upon them.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed
                                great unto me:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> There was a little city, and few men within it; and there
                                came a great king against it,
                                and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his
                                wisdom delivered the city; yet
                                no man remembered that same poor man.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16</span> Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the
                                poor man's wisdom is
                                despised, and his words are not heard.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of
                                him that ruleth among
                                fools.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18</span> Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner
                                destroyeth much good.</p>

                            <h5>Ecclesiastes 10:1-7</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth
                                a stinking savour: so doth a
                                little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at
                                his left.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his
                                wisdom faileth him, and he saith
                                to every one that he is a fool.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy
                                place; for yielding
                                pacifieth great offences.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error
                                which proceedeth from the
                                ruler:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as
                                servants upon the earth.</p>

                            <h2>1 Thessalonians 5</h2>
                            <h5>1 Thessalonians 5</h5>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16</span> Rejoice evermore.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> Pray without ceasing.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18</span> In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19</span> Quench not the Spirit.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20</span> Despise not prophesyings.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21</span> Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22</span> Abstain from all appearance of evil.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>23</span> And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>24</span> Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>25</span> Brethren, pray for us.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>26</span> Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>27</span> I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>28</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</p>

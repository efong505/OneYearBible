                            <h2>Ecclesiastes 10:8 - Song of Solomon 2:7</h2>
                            <h5 class="mt-2">Ecclesiastes 10:8-20</h5>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16</span> Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18</span> By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19</span> A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20</span> Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</p>

                            <h5>Ecclesiastes 11</h5>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.</p>

                            <h5>Ecclesiastes 12</h5>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</p>

                            <h5>Song of Solomon 1</h5>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> The song of songs, which is Solomon's.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> A bundle of myrrh is my wellbeloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16</span> Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is green.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.</p>

                            <h5>Song of Solomon 2:1-7</h5>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.</p>

                            <h5>2 Thessalonians 1</h5>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>

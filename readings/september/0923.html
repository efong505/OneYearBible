                            <h5>Isaiah 2</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and
                                Jerusalem.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain
                                of the LORD'S house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be
                                exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"> <span>3 </span>many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to
                                the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his
                                ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the
                                word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many
                                people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into
                                pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn
                                war any more.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span> O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of
                                the LORD.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span> Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob,
                                because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and
                                they please themselves in the children of strangers.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is ere any
                                end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of
                                their chariots:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of
                                their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth
                                himself: therefore forgive them not.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"> <span>10 </span>Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of

                            <p class="fnb"> <span>11 </span>The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness
                                of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"> <span>12 </span>For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one
                                that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought
                                low:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"> <span>13 </span>And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted

                            <p class="fnb"> <span>14 </span>And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that
                                are lifted up,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"> <span>15 </span>And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"> <span>16 </span>And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant
                                pictures.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"> <span>17 </span>And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the
                                haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fnb"> <span>18 </span>And the idols he shall utterly abolish.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"> <span>19 </span>And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the
                                caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he
                                ariseth to shake terribly the earth.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"> <span>20 </span>In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his
                                idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the
                                bats;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"> <span>21 </span>To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the
                                ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to
                                shake terribly the earth.</p>

                            <h5>Isaiah 3</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from
                                Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole
                                stay of water,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the
                                prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the
                                counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall
                                rule over them.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his
                                father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy
                                hand:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer;
                                for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their
                                tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and
                                they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have
                                rewarded evil unto themselves.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for
                                they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10 </span>Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward
                                of his hands shall be given him.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11 </span>As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women
                                rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way
                                of thy paths.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12 </span>The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the
                                people.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13 </span>The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his
                                people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the
                                poor is in your houses.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14 </span>What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the
                                faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15 </span>What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the
                                faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16 </span>Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are
                                haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as
                                they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17 </span>Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the
                                head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18 </span>In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their
                                tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the
                                moon,</p>

                            <h5>Isaiah 4</h5>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man,
                                saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by
                                thy name, to take away our reproach.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and
                                glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are
                                escaped of Israel.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and
                                he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written
                                among the living in Jerusalem:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the
                                daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof
                                by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount
                                Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming
                                fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defence.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime
                                from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.</p>


                            <h5>Isaiah 5:1-7</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved
                                touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and
                                planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a
                                winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth
                                wild grapes.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge,
                                I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not
                                done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth
                                wild grapes?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard:
                                I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall
                                thereof, and it shall be trodden down:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged;
                                but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain
                                no rain upon it.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel,
                                and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold
                                oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.</p>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may
                                have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men:
                                for all men have not faith.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you
                                from evil.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both
                                do and will do the things which we command you.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into
                                the patient waiting for Christ.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus
                                Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not
                                after the tradition which he received of us.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved
                                not ourselves disorderly among you;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought
                                with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:
                            </p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an
                                ensample unto you to follow us.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10 </span>For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that
                                if any would not work, neither should he eat.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11 </span>For we hear that there are some which walk among you
                                disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12 </span>Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord
                                Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13 </span>But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14 </span>And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that
                                man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15 </span>Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16 </span>Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all
                                means. The Lord be with you all.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17 </span>The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token
                                in every epistle: so I write.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18 </span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</p>

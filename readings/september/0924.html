                            <h2>Isaiah 5:8 - 7:25</h2>

                            <h5>Isaiah 5:8-30</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>Woe to those who join house to house [and by violently expelling the poorer occupants], who add field to field until there is no place for others and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>In my [prophetic] ears the Lord of hosts said, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and beautiful ones shall be without inhabitant.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10 </span>For ten acres of vineyard shall yield only about eight gallons, and ten bushels of seed will produce only about a bushel of grain.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11 </span>Woe unto those who rise early in the morning to pursue strong drink, who tarry late into the night till wine inflames them!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12 </span>They have lyre and harp, tambourine and flute and wine at their feasts, but they do not regard the deeds of the Lord, neither do they consider the operation of His hands [in mercy and in judgment].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13 </span>Therefore my people go into captivity [to their enemies] without knowing it and because they have no knowledge [of God]. And their honorable men [their glory] are famished, and their common people are parched with thirst.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14 </span>Therefore Sheol (the unseen state, the realm of the dead) has enlarged its appetite and opened its mouth without measure; and [Jerusalem's] nobility and her multitude and her pomp and tumult and [the drunken reveler] who exults in her descend into it.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15 </span>And the common man is bowed down, and the great man is brought low, and the eyes of the haughty are humbled.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16 </span>But the Lord of hosts is exalted in justice, and God, the Holy One, shows Himself holy in righteousness and through righteous judgments.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17 </span>Then shall the lambs feed [among the ruins] as in their own pasture, and [among] the desolate places of the [exiled] rich shall sojourners and aliens eat.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18 </span>Woe to those who draw [calamity] with cords of iniquity and falsehood, who bring punishment to themselves with a cart rope of wickedness,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19 </span>Who say, Let [the Holy One] make haste and speed His [prophesied] vengeance, that we may see it; and let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20 </span>Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21 </span>Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and prudent and shrewd in their own sight!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22 </span>Woe to those who are mighty heroes at drinking wine and men of strength in mixing strong drinks—</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>23 </span>Who justify and acquit the guilty for a bribe, but take away the rights of the innocent and righteous from them!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>24 </span>Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root shall be like rottenness and their blossom shall go up like fine dust—because they have rejected and cast away the law and the teaching of the Lord of hosts and have not believed but have treated scornfully and have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>25 </span>Therefore is the anger of the Lord kindled against His people, and He has stretched forth His hand against them and has smitten them. And the mountains trembled, and their dead bodies were like refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this, His anger is not turned away, but His hand is still stretched out [in judgment].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>26 </span>And He will lift up a signal to call together a hostile people from afar [to execute His judgment on Judea], and will hiss for them from the end of the earth [as bees are hissed from their hives], and behold, they shall come with speed, swiftly!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>27 </span>None is weary or stumbles among them, none slumbers or sleeps; nor is the girdle of their loins loosened or the latchet (thong) of their shoes broken;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>28 </span>Their arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses' hoofs seem like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>29 </span>Their roaring is like that of a lioness, they roar like young lions; they growl and seize their prey and carry it safely away, and there is none to deliver it.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>30 </span>And in that day they [the army from afar] shall roar against [the Jews] like the roaring of the sea. And if one looks to the land, behold, there is darkness and distress; and the light [itself] will be darkened by the clouds of it.</p>                            

                            <h5>Isaiah 6</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>In the year that King Uzziah died, [in a vision] I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and the skirts of His train filled the [most holy part of the] temple.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>Above Him stood the seraphim; each had six wings: with two [each] covered his [own] face, and with two [each] covered his feet, and with two [each] flew.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>And one cried to another and said, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>Then said I, Woe is me! For I am undone and ruined, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>Then flew one of the seraphim [heavenly beings] to me, having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with tongs from off the altar;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>And with it he touched my mouth and said, Behold, this has touched your lips; your iniquity and guilt are taken away, and your sin is completely atoned for and forgiven.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send? And who will go for Us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>And He said, Go and tell this people, Hear and hear continually, but understand not; and see and see continually, but do not apprehend with your mind.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10 </span>Make the heart of this people fat; and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their hearts and turn again and be healed.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11 </span>Then said I, Lord, how long? And He answered, Until cities lie waste without inhabitant and houses without man, and the land is utterly desolate,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12 </span>And the Lord removes [His] people far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13 </span>And though a tenth [of the people] remain in the land, it will be for their destruction [eaten up and burned] like a terebinth tree or like an oak whose stump and substance remain when they are felled or have cast their leaves. The holy seed [the elect remnant] is the stump and substance [of Israel].</p>

                            <h5>Isaiah 7</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>In the days of Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah king of Judah, Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel went up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but they could not conquer it.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>And the house of David [Judah] was told, Syria is allied with Ephraim [Israel]. And the heart [of Ahaz] and the hearts of his people trembled and shook, as the trees of the forest tremble and shake with the wind.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>Then said the Lord to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz [king of Judah], you and your son Shear-jashub [a remnant shall return], at the end of the aqueduct or canal of the Upper Pool on the highway to the Fuller's Field;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>And say to him, Take heed and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted because of these two stumps of smoking firebrands—at the fierce anger of [these] Rezin and Syria and of the son of Remaliah.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>Because Syria, Ephraim [Israel], and the son of Remaliah have purposed evil against you [Judah], saying,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>Let us go up against Judah and harass and terrify it; and let us cleave it asunder [each of us taking a portion], and set a [vassal] king in the midst of it, namely the son of Tabeel,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>Thus says the Lord God: It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>For the head [the capital] of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is [King] Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be broken to pieces so that it will no longer be a people.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>And the head (the capital) of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son [Pekah]. If you will not believe and trust and rely [on God and on the words of God's prophet instead of Assyria], surely you will not be established nor will you remain.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10 </span>Moreover, the Lord spoke again to Ahaz, saying,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11 </span>Ask for yourself a sign (a token or proof) of the Lord your God [one that will convince you that God has spoken and will keep His word]; ask it either in the depth below or in the height above [let it be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12 </span>But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13 </span>And [Isaiah] said, Hear then, O house of David! Is it a small thing for you to weary and try the patience of men, but will you weary and try the patience of my God also?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14 </span>Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign: Behold, the young woman who is unmarried and a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel [God with us].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15 </span>Butter and curds and wild honey shall he eat when he knows [enough] to refuse the evil and choose the good.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16 </span>For before the child shall know [enough] to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land [Canaan] whose two kings you abhor and of whom you are in sickening dread shall be forsaken [both Ephraim and Syria].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17 </span>The Lord shall bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father's house such days as have not come since the day that Ephraim [the ten northern tribes] departed from Judah—even the king of Assyria.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18 </span>And in that day the Lord shall whistle for the fly [the numerous and troublesome foe] that is in the whole extent of the canal country of Egypt and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19 </span>And these [enemies like flies and bees] shall come and shall rest all of them in the desolate and rugged valleys and deep ravines and in the clefts of the rocks, and on all the thornbushes and on all the pastures.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20 </span>In the same day [will the people of Judah be utterly stripped of belongings], the Lord will shave with the razor that is hired from the parts beyond the River [Euphrates]—even with the king of Assyria—[that razor will shave] the head and the hair of the legs, and it shall also consume the beard [leaving Judah with open shame and scorn].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21 </span>And [because of the desolation brought on by the invaders] in that day, a man will [be so poor that he will] keep alive only a young milk cow and two sheep;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22 </span>And because of the abundance of milk that they will give, he will eat butter and curds, for butter and curds will be the food of all who are left in the land.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>23 </span>And in that day, in every place where there used to be a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels, there will be briers and thorns.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>24 </span>With arrows and with bow shall a man come there, because all the land will be briers and thorns.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>25 </span>And as for all the hills that were formerly cultivated with mattock and hoe, you will not go there for fear of briers and thorns; but they will become a place where cattle are let loose and where sheep tread.</p>

                            <h2>1 Timothy 1</h2>
                            <h5>1 Timothy 1</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>Paul, an apostle (special messenger) of Christ Jesus by appointment and command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus (the Messiah), our Hope,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>To Timothy, my true son in the faith: Grace (spiritual blessing and favor), mercy, and [heart] peace [be yours] from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>As I urged you when I was on my way to Macedonia, stay on where you are at Ephesus in order that you may warn and admonish and charge certain individuals not to teach any different doctrine,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>Nor to give importance to or occupy themselves with legends (fables, myths) and endless genealogies, which foster and promote useless speculations and questionings rather than acceptance in faith of God's administration and the divine training that is in faith (in that leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence)—</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>Whereas the object and purpose of our instruction and charge is love, which springs from a pure heart and a good (clear) conscience and sincere (unfeigned) faith.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>But certain individuals have missed the mark on this very matter [and] have wandered away into vain arguments and discussions and purposeless talk.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>They are ambitious to be doctors of the Law (teachers of the Mosaic ritual), but they have no understanding either of the words and terms they use or of the subjects about which they make [such] dogmatic assertions.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>Now we recognize and know that the Law is good if anyone uses it lawfully [for the purpose for which it was designed],</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>Knowing and understanding this: that the Law is not enacted for the righteous (the upright and just, who are in right standing with God), but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinful, for the irreverent and profane, for those who strike and beat and [even] murder fathers and strike and beat and [even] murder mothers, for manslayers,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10 </span>For impure and immoral persons, for those who abuse themselves with men, for kidnapers, for liars, for perjurers—and whatever else is opposed to wholesome teaching and sound doctrine</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11 </span>As laid down by the glorious Gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12 </span>I give thanks to Him Who has granted me [the needed] strength and made me able [for this], Christ Jesus our Lord, because He has judged and counted me faithful and trustworthy, appointing me to [this stewardship of] the ministry.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13 </span>Though I formerly blasphemed and persecuted and was shamefully and outrageously and aggressively insulting [to Him], nevertheless, I obtained mercy because I had acted out of ignorance in unbelief.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14 </span>And the grace (unmerited favor and blessing) of our Lord [actually] flowed out superabundantly and beyond measure for me, accompanied by faith and love that are [to be realized] in Christ Jesus.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15 </span>The saying is sure and true and worthy of full and universal acceptance, that Christ Jesus (the Messiah) came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am foremost.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16 </span>But I obtained mercy for the reason that in me, as the foremost [of sinners], Jesus Christ might show forth and display all His perfect long-suffering and patience for an example to [encourage] those who would thereafter believe on Him for [the gaining of] eternal life.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17 </span>Now to the King of eternity, incorruptible and immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever (to the ages of ages). Amen (so be it).</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18 </span>This charge and admonition I commit in trust to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with prophetic intimations which I formerly received concerning you, so that inspired and aided by them you may wage the good warfare,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19 </span>Holding fast to faith (that leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence) and having a good (clear) conscience. By rejecting and thrusting from them [their conscience], some individuals have made shipwreck of their faith.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20 </span>Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan in order that they may be disciplined [by punishment and learn] not to blaspheme.</p>

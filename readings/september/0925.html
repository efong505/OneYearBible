                            <h2>Isaiah 8:1-9:21</h2>

                            <h5>Isaiah 8:1-22</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>Then the Lord said to me, Take a large tablet [of wood, metal, or stone] and write upon it with a graving tool and in ordinary characters [which the humblest man can read]: Belonging to Maher-shalal-hash-baz [they (the Assyrians) hasten to the spoil (of Syria and Israel), they speed to the prey].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>And I took faithful witnesses to record and attest [this prophecy] for me, Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>And I approached [my wife] the prophetess, and when she had conceived and borne a son, the Lord said to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz [as a continual reminder to the people of the prophecy],</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>For before the child knows how to say, My father or my mother, the riches of Damascus [Syria's capital] and the spoil of Samaria [Israel's capital] shall be carried away before the king of Assyria.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>The Lord spoke to me yet again and said,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>Because this people [Israel and Judah] have refused and despised the waters of Shiloah [Siloam, the only perennial fountain of Jerusalem, and symbolic of God's protection and sustaining power] that go softly, and rejoice in and with Rezin [the king of Syria] and Remaliah's son [Pekah the king of Israel],</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings upon them the waters of the River [Euphrates], strong and many—even the king of Assyria and all his glory; and it will rise over all its channels, go over all its banks.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>And it will sweep on into Judah; it will overflow and go over [the hills], reaching even to the neck [of which Jerusalem is the head], and the outstretched wings [of the armies of Assyria] shall fill the breadth of Your land, O Immanuel [Messiah, God with us]!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>Make an uproar and be broken in pieces, O you peoples [rage, raise the war cry, do your worst, and be utterly dismayed]! Give ear, all you [our enemies] of far countries. Gird yourselves [for war], and be thrown into consternation! Gird yourselves, and be [utterly] dismayed!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10 </span>Take counsel together [against Judah], but it shall come to nought; speak the word, but it will not stand, for God is with us [Immanuel]!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11 </span>For the Lord spoke thus to me with His strong hand [upon me], and warned and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12 </span>Do not call conspiracy [or hard, or holy] all that this people will call conspiracy [or hard, or holy]; neither be in fear of what they fear, nor [make others afraid and] in dread.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13 </span>The Lord of hosts—regard Him as holy and honor His holy name [by regarding Him as your only hope of safety], and let Him be your fear and let Him be your dread [lest you offend Him by your fear of man and distrust of Him].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14 </span>And He shall be a sanctuary [a sacred and indestructible asylum to those who reverently fear and trust in Him]; but He shall be a Stone of stumbling and a Rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15 </span>And many among them shall stumble thereon; and they shall fall and be broken, and be snared and taken.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16 </span>Bind up the testimony, seal the law and the teaching among my [Isaiah's] disciples.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17 </span>And I will wait for the Lord, Who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob; and I will look for and hope in Him.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18 </span>Behold, I and the children whom the Lord has given me are signs and wonders [that are to take place] in Israel from the Lord of hosts, Who dwells on Mount Zion.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19 </span>And when the people [instead of putting their trust in God] shall say to you, Consult for direction mediums and wizards who chirp and mutter, should not a people seek and consult their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20 </span>[Direct such people] to the teaching and to the testimony! If their teachings are not in accord with this word, it is surely because there is no dawn and no morning for them.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21 </span>And they [who consult mediums and wizards] shall pass through [the land] sorely distressed and hungry; and when they are hungry, they will fret, and will curse by their king and their God; and whether they look upward</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22 </span>Or look to the earth, they will behold only distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish, and into thick darkness and widespread, obscure night they shall be driven away.</p>

                            <h5>Isaiah 9:1-21</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>But [in the midst of judgment there is the promise and the certainty of the Lord's deliverance and] there shall be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time [the Lord] brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time He will make it glorious, by the way of the Sea [of Galilee, the land] beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>The people who walked in darkness have seen a great Light; those who dwelt in the land of intense darkness and the shadow of death, upon them has the Light shined.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>You [O Lord] have multiplied the nation and increased their joy; they rejoice before You like the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil [of battle].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>For the yoke of [Israel's] burden, and the staff or rod for [goading] their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor, You have broken as in the day of [Gideon with] Midian.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>For every [tramping] warrior's war boots and all his armor in the battle tumult and every garment rolled in blood shall be burned as fuel for the fire.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>For to us a Child is born, to us a Son is given; and the government shall be upon His shoulder, and His name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father [of Eternity], Prince of Peace.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>Of the increase of His government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from the [latter] time forth, even forevermore. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>The Lord has sent a word against Jacob [the ten tribes], and it has lighted upon Israel [the ten tribes, the kingdom of Ephraim].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>And all the people shall know it—even Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria [its capital]—who say in pride and stoutness of heart:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10 </span>The bricks have fallen, but we will build [all the better] with hewn stones; the sycamores have been cut down, but we will put [costlier] cedars in their place.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11 </span>Therefore the Lord has stirred up the adversaries [the Assyrians] of Rezin [king of Syria] against [Ephraim], and He will stir up their enemies and arm them,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12 </span>The Syrians [compelled to fight with their enemies, going] before [on the east] and the Philistines behind [on the west]; and they will devour Israel with open mouth. For all this, [God's] anger is not [then] turned away, but His hand is still stretched out [in judgment].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13 </span>Yet the people turn not to Him Who smote them, neither do they seek [inquire for or require as their vital need] the Lord of hosts.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14 </span>Therefore the Lord will cut off from Israel head and tail [the highest and the lowest]—[high] palm branch and [low] rush in one day;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15 </span>The elderly and honored man, he is the head; and the prophet who teaches lies, he is the tail.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16 </span>For they who lead this people cause them to err, and they who are led [astray] by them are swallowed up (destroyed).</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17 </span>Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men, neither will He have compassion on their fatherless and widows, for everyone is profane and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this, [God's] anger is not turned away, but His hand is still stretched out [in judgment].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18 </span>For wickedness burns like a fire; it devours the briers and thorns, and it kindles in the thickets of the forest; they roll upward in a column of smoke.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19 </span>Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts the land is darkened and burned up, and the people are like fuel for the fire; no man spares his brother.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20 </span>They snatch on the right hand and are still hungry, and they eat on the left hand and are not satisfied; each eats and devours the flesh of his own arm—</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21 </span>Manasseh [thirsts for the blood of his brother] Ephraim, and Ephraim [for that of] Manasseh; but together they are against Judah. For all this, [God's] anger is not turned away, but His hand is still stretched out [in judgment].</p>                                                
                        
                            <h5>Isaiah 10:1-19</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees and to the magistrates who keep causing and writing trouble and perverseness which they have prescribed</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>To turn aside the needy from justice and to make plunder of the rightful claims of the poor of My people, that widows may be their spoil, and that they may make the fatherless their prey!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>And what will you do in the day of visitation [of God's wrath], and in the desolation which shall come from afar? To whom will you flee for help? And where will you deposit [for safekeeping] your wealth and with whom leave your glory?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>Without Me they shall bow down among the prisoners, and they shall fall [overwhelmed] under the heaps of the slain [on the battlefield]. For all this, [God's] anger is not turned away, but His hand is still stretched out [in judgment].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>Woe to the Assyrian, the rod of My anger, the staff in whose hand is My indignation and fury [against Israel's disobedience]!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>I send [the Assyrian] against a hypocritical and godless nation and against the people of My wrath; I command him to take the spoil and to seize the prey and to tread them down like the mire in the streets.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>However, this is not his intention [nor is the Assyrian aware that he is doing this at My bidding], neither does his mind so think and plan; but it is in his mind to destroy and cut off many nations.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>For [the Assyrian] says, Are not my princes all kings?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>Is not Calno [of Babylonia conquered] like Carchemish [on the Euphrates]? Is not Hamath [in Upper Syria] like Arpad [her neighbor]? Is not Samaria [in Israel] like Damascus [in Syria]? [Have any of these cities been able to resist Assyria? Not one!]</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10 </span>As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols [which were unable to defend them,] whose graven images were more to be feared and dreaded and more mighty than those of Jerusalem and of Samaria—</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11 </span>Shall I not be able to do to Jerusalem and her images as I have done to Samaria and her idols? [says the Assyrian]</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12 </span>Therefore when the Lord has completed all His work [of chastisement and purification to be executed] on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, it shall be that He will inflict punishment on the fruit [the thoughts, words, and deeds] of the stout and arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the haughtiness of his pride.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13 </span>For [the Assyrian king] has said, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I have understanding; I have removed the boundaries of the peoples and have robbed their treasures; and like a bull I have brought down those who sat on thrones and the inhabitants.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14 </span>And my hand has found like a nest the wealth of the people; and as one gathers eggs that are forsaken, so I have gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved its wing, or that opened its mouth or chirped.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15 </span>Shall the ax boast itself against him who chops with it? Or shall the saw magnify itself against him who wields it back and forth? As if a rod should wield those who lift it up, or as if a staff should lift itself up as if it were not wood [but a man of God]!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16 </span>Therefore will the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send leanness among [the Assyrian's] fat ones; and under his glory there shall be kindled a burning like the burning of fire.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17 </span>And the Light of Israel shall become a fire and His Holy One a flame, and it will burn and devour [the Assyrian's] thorns and briers in one day.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18 </span>[The Lord] will consume the glory of the [Assyrian's] forest and of his fruitful field, both soul and body; and it shall be as when a sick man pines away.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19 </span>And the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a child may make a list of them.</p>

                            <h2>1 Timothy 2</h2>
                            <h5>1 Timothy 2</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>First of all, then, I admonish and urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be offered on behalf of all men,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>For kings and all who are in positions of authority or high responsibility, that [outwardly] we may pass a quiet and undisturbed life [and inwardly] a peaceable one in all godliness and reverence and seriousness in every way.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>This [kind of praying] is good and acceptable and pleasing in the sight of God our Savior,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>Who wishes all men to be saved and [increasingly] to perceive and recognize and discern and know precisely and correctly the [divine] Truth.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>For there [is only] one God, and [only] one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>Who gave Himself as a ransom for all [people, a fact that was] attested to at the right and proper time.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>And of this matter I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (special messenger)—I am speaking the truth in Christ, I do not falsify [when I say this]—a teacher of the Gentiles in [the realm of] faith and truth.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>I desire therefore that in every place men should pray, without anger or quarreling or resentment or doubt [in their minds], lifting up holy hands.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>Also [I desire] that women should adorn themselves modestly and appropriately and sensibly in seemly apparel, not with [elaborate] hair arrangement or gold or pearls or expensive clothing,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10 </span>But by doing good deeds (deeds in themselves good and for the good and advantage of those contacted by them), as befits women who profess reverential fear for and devotion to God.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11 </span>Let a woman learn in quietness, in entire submissiveness.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12 </span>I allow no woman to teach or to have authority over men; she is to remain in quietness and keep silence [in religious assemblies].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13 </span>For Adam was first formed, then Eve;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14 </span>And it was not Adam who was deceived, but [the] woman who was deceived and deluded and fell into transgression.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15 </span>Nevertheless [the sentence put upon women of pain in motherhood does not hinder their souls' salvation, and] they will be saved [eternally] if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-control, [saved indeed] through the Childbearing or by the birth of the divine Child.</p>                                                                                </div>

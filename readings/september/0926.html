                            <h2>Isaiah 10:20-13:22</h2>

                            <h5>Isaiah 10:20-34</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>20 </span>And it shall be in that day that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more lean upon him who smote them, but will lean upon the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21 </span>A remnant will return, that is, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22 </span>For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return [and survive]. The destruction [that is] determined shall overflow with righteousness [and the infliction of just punishment].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>23 </span>For the Lord, the Lord of hosts, will make a full end, whatever is determined or decreed [in Israel], in the midst of all the earth.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>24 </span>Therefore thus says the Lord, the Lord of hosts, O My people who dwell in Zion, do not be afraid of the Assyrian, who smites you with a rod and lifts up his staff against you, as [the king of] Egypt did.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>25 </span>For yet a very little while and My indignation against you shall be accomplished, and My anger shall be directed to destruction [of the Assyrian].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>26 </span>And the Lord of hosts shall stir up and brandish a scourge against them as when He smote Midian at the rock of Oreb; and as His rod was over the [Red] Sea, so shall He lift it up as He did in [the flight from] Egypt.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>27 </span>And it shall be in that day that the burden of [the Assyrian] shall depart from your shoulders, and his yoke from your neck. The yoke shall be destroyed because of fatness [which prevents it from going around your neck].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>28 </span>He is come to Aiath, he is passed through Migron; at Michmash he lays up his baggage [for storage].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>29 </span>They go through the pass, they make Geba their camping place for the night; Ramah is afraid and trembles, Gibeah [the city] of [King] Saul flees.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>30 </span>Cry aloud [in consternation], O Daughter of Gallim! Hearken, O Laishah! [Answer her] O you poor Anathoth!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>31 </span>Madmenah is in flight; the inhabitants of Gebim flee to save themselves.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>32 </span>This very day [the Assyrian] will halt at Nob [the city of priests], shaking his fist at the mountain of the Daughter of Zion, at the hill of Jerusalem.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>33 </span>Behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, will lop off the boughs with terrifying force; the tall in stature will be hewn down and the lofty will be brought low.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>34 </span>And He will cut down the thickets of the forest with an ax, and Lebanon [the Assyrian] with its majestic trees shall fall by the Mighty One.</p>

                            <h5>Isaiah 11</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>And there shall come forth a Shoot out of the stock of Jesse [David's father], and a Branch out of his roots shall grow and bear fruit.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him—the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and of the reverential and obedient fear of the Lord—</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>And shall make Him of quick understanding, and His delight shall be in the reverential and obedient fear of the Lord. And He shall not judge by the sight of His eyes, neither decide by the hearing of His ears;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>But with righteousness and justice shall He judge the poor and decide with fairness for the meek, the poor, and the downtrodden of the earth; and He shall smite the earth and the oppressor with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath of His lips He shall slay the wicked.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>And righteousness shall be the girdle of His waist and faithfulness the girdle of His loins.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and the fatted domestic animal together; and a little child shall lead them.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>And the cow and the bear shall feed together, their young ones shall lie down together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>And the sucking child shall play over the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder's den.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>They shall not hurt or destroy in all My holy mountain, for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10 </span>And it shall be in that day that the Root of Jesse shall stand as a signal for the peoples; of Him shall the nations inquire and seek knowledge, and His dwelling shall be glory [His rest glorious]!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11 </span>And in that day the Lord shall again lift up His hand a second time to recover (acquire and deliver) the remnant of His people which is left, from Assyria, from Lower Egypt, from Pathros, from Ethiopia, from Elam [in Persia], from Shinar [Babylonia], from Hamath [in Upper Syria], and from the countries bordering on the [Mediterranean] Sea.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12 </span>And He will raise up a signal for the nations and will assemble the outcasts of Israel and will gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13 </span>The envy and jealousy of Ephraim also shall depart, and they who vex and harass Judah from outside or inside shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex and harass Ephraim.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14 </span>But [with united forces Ephraim and Judah] will swoop down upon the shoulders of the Philistines' [land sloping] toward the west; together they will strip the people on the east [the Arabs]. They will lay their hands upon Edom and Moab, and the Ammonites will obey them.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15 </span>And the Lord will utterly destroy (doom and dry up) the tongue of the Egyptian sea [the west fork of the Red Sea]; and with His [mighty] scorching wind He will wave His hand over the river [Nile] and will smite it into seven channels and will cause men to cross over dry-shod.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16 </span>And there shall be a highway from Assyria for the remnant left of His people, as there was for Israel when they came up out of the land of Egypt.</p>

                            <h5>Isaiah 12</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>And in that day you will say, I will give thanks to You, O Lord; for though You were angry with me, Your anger has turned away, and You comfort me.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>Behold, God, my salvation! I will trust and not be afraid, for the Lord God is my strength and song; yes, He has become my salvation.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>Therefore with joy will you draw water from the wells of salvation.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>And in that day you will say, Give thanks to the Lord, call upon His name and by means of His name [in solemn entreaty]; declare and make known His deeds among the peoples of the earth, proclaim that His name is exalted!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>Sing praises to the Lord, for He has done excellent things [gloriously]; let this be made known to all the earth.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>Cry aloud and shout joyfully, you women and inhabitants of Zion, for great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.</p>                        

                            <h5>Isaiah 13</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>The mournful, inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up) concerning Babylon which Isaiah son of Amoz saw [with prophetic insight]:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>Raise up a signal banner upon the high and bare mountain, summon them [the Medes and Persians] with loud voice and beckoning hand that they may enter the gates of the [Babylonian] nobles.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>I Myself [says the Lord] have commanded My designated ones and have summoned My mighty men to execute My anger, even My proudly exulting ones [the Medes and Persians]—those who are made to triumph for My honor.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>Hark, the uproar of a multitude in the mountains, like that of a great people! The noise of the tumult of the kingdoms of the nations gathering together! The Lord of hosts is mustering the host for the battle.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>They come from a distant country, from the uttermost part of the heavens [the far east]—even the Lord and the weapons of His indignation—to seize and destroy the whole land.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>Wail, for the day of the Lord is at hand; as destruction from the Almighty and Sufficient One [Shaddai] will it come!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>Therefore will all hands be feeble, and every man's heart will melt.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>And they [of Babylon] shall be dismayed and terrified, pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman in childbirth. They will gaze stupefied and aghast at one another, their faces will be aflame [from the effects of the unprecedented warfare].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>Behold, the day of the Lord is coming!—fierce, with wrath and raging anger—to make the land and the [whole] earth a desolation and to destroy out of it its sinners.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10 </span>For the stars of the heavens and their constellations will not give their light; the sun will be darkened at its rising and the moon will not shed its light.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11 </span>And I, the Lord, will punish the world for its evil, and the wicked for their guilt and iniquity; I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible and the boasting of the violent and ruthless.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12 </span>I will make a man more rare than fine gold, and mankind scarcer than the pure gold of Ophir.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13 </span>Therefore I will make the heavens tremble; and the earth shall be shaken out of its place at the wrath of the Lord of hosts in the day of His fierce anger.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14 </span>And like the chased roe or gazelle, and like sheep that no man gathers, each [foreign resident] will turn to his own people, and each will flee to his own land.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15 </span>Everyone who is found will be thrust through, and everyone who is connected with the slain and is caught will fall by the sword.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16 </span>Their infants also will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be plundered and their wives ravished.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17 </span>Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who have no regard for silver and do not delight in gold [and thus cannot be bribed].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18 </span>Their bows will cut down the young men [of Babylon]; and they will have no pity on the fruit of the womb, their eyes will not spare children.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19 </span>And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans' pride, shall be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God overthrew them.</p>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>21 </span>But wild beasts of the desert will lie down there, and the people's houses will be full of dolefully howling creatures; and ostriches will dwell there, and wild goats [like demons] will dance there.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22 </span>And wolves and howling creatures will cry and answer in the deserted castles, and jackals in the pleasant palaces. And [Babylon's] time has nearly come, and her days will not be prolonged.</p>

                            <h2>1 Timothy 3</h2>
                            <h5>1 Timothy 3</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>The saying is true and irrefutable: If any man [eagerly] seeks the office of bishop (superintendent, overseer), he desires an excellent task (work).</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>Now a bishop (superintendent, overseer) must give no grounds for accusation but must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, circumspect and temperate and self-controlled; [he must be] sensible and well behaved and dignified and lead an orderly (disciplined) life; [he must be] hospitable [showing love for and being a friend to the believers, especially strangers or foreigners, and be] a capable and qualified teacher,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>Not given to wine, not combative but gentle and considerate, not quarrelsome but forbearing and peaceable, and not a lover of money [insatiable for wealth and ready to obtain it by questionable means].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>He must rule his own household well, keeping his children under control, with true dignity, commanding their respect in every way and keeping them respectful.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>For if a man does not know how to rule his own household, how is he to take care of the church of God?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>He must not be a new convert, or he may [develop a beclouded and stupid state of mind] as the result of pride [be blinded by conceit, and] fall into the condemnation that the devil [once] did.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>Furthermore, he must have a good reputation and be well thought of by those outside [the church], lest he become involved in slander and incur reproach and fall into the devil's trap.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>In like manner the deacons [must be] worthy of respect, not shifty and double-talkers but sincere in what they say, not given to much wine, not greedy for base gain [craving wealth and resorting to ignoble and dishonest methods of getting it].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>They must possess the mystic secret of the faith [Christian truth as hidden from ungodly men] with a clear conscience.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10 </span>And let them also be tried and investigated and proved first; then, if they turn out to be above reproach, let them serve [as deacons].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11 </span>[The] women likewise must be worthy of respect and serious, not gossipers, but temperate and self-controlled, [thoroughly] trustworthy in all things.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12 </span>Let deacons be the husbands of but one wife, and let them manage [their] children and their own households well.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13 </span>For those who perform well as deacons acquire a good standing for themselves and also gain much confidence and freedom and boldness in the faith which is [founded on and centers] in Christ Jesus.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14 </span>Although I hope to come to you before long, I am writing these instructions to you so that,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15 </span>If I am detained, you may know how people ought to conduct themselves in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and stay (the prop and support) of the Truth.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16 </span>And great and important and weighty, we confess, is the hidden truth (the mystic secret) of godliness. He [God] was made visible in human flesh, justified and vindicated in the [Holy] Spirit, was seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, [and] taken up in glory.</p>

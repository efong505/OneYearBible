                            <h5>Isaiah 14</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob [the captive Jews in Babylon] and will again choose Israel and set them in their own land; and foreigners will join them and will cleave to the house of Jacob (Israel).</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>And the peoples [of Babylonia] shall take them and bring them to their own place [in Judea]; and the house of Israel shall possess [those foreigners] as servants and handmaids in the Lord's land; and they shall take captive [not by might, but by right] those whose captives they have been, and they shall rule over their [former] oppressors.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>When the Lord has given you rest from your sorrow and pain and from your trouble and unrest and from the hard service with which you were made to serve,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>You shall take up this [taunting] parable against the king of Babylon and say, How the oppressor has stilled [the restless insolence]! The golden and exacting city has ceased!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the [tyrant] rulers,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>Who smote the peoples in anger with incessant blows and trod down the nations in wrath with unrelenting persecution—[until] he who smote is persecuted and no one hinders any more.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>The whole earth is at rest and is quiet; they break forth into singing.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>Yes, the fir trees and cypresses rejoice at you [O kings of Babylon], even the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since you have been laid low, no woodcutter comes up against us.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>Sheol (Hades, the place of the dead) below is stirred up to meet you at your coming [O tyrant Babylonian rulers]; it stirs up the shades of the dead to greet you—even all the chief ones of the earth; it raises from their thrones [in astonishment at your humbled condition] all the kings of the nations.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10 </span>All of them will [tauntingly] say to you, Have you also become weak as we are? Have you become like us?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11 </span>Your pomp and magnificence are brought down to Sheol (the underworld), along with the sound of your harps; the maggots [which prey upon dead bodies] are spread out under you and worms cover you [O Babylonian rulers].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12 </span>How have you fallen from heaven, O light-bringer and daystar, son of the morning! How you have been cut down to the ground, you who weakened and laid low the nations [O blasphemous, satanic king of Babylon!]</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13 </span>And you said in your heart, I will ascend to heaven; I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit upon the mount of assembly in the uttermost north.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14 </span>I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15 </span>Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol (Hades), to the innermost recesses of the pit (the region of the dead).</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16 </span>Those who see you will gaze at you and consider you, saying, Is this the man who made the earth tremble, who shook kingdoms?—</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17 </span>Who made the world like a wilderness and overthrew its cities, who would not permit his prisoners to return home?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18 </span>All the kings of the nations, all of them lie sleeping in glorious array, each one in his own sepulcher.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19 </span>But you are cast away from your tomb like a loathed growth or premature birth or an abominable branch [of the family] and like the raiment of the slain; and you are clothed with the slain, those thrust through with the sword, who go down to the stones of the pit [into which carcasses are thrown], like a dead body trodden underfoot.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20 </span>You shall not be joined with them in burial, because you have destroyed your land and have slain your people. May the descendants of evildoers nevermore be named!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21 </span>Prepare a slaughtering place for his sons because of the guilt and iniquity of their fathers, so that they may not rise, possess the earth, and fill the face of the world with cities.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22 </span>And I will rise up against them, says the Lord of hosts, and cut off from Babylon name and remnant, and son and son's son, says the Lord.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>23 </span>I will also make it a possession of the hedgehog and porcupine, and of marshes and pools of water, and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction, says the Lord of hosts.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>24 </span>The Lord of hosts has sworn, saying, Surely, as I have thought and planned, so shall it come to pass, and as I have purposed, so shall it stand—</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>25 </span>That I will break the Assyrian in My land, and upon My mountains I will tread him underfoot. Then shall the [Assyrian's] yoke depart from [the people of Judah], and his burden depart from their shoulders.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>26 </span>This is the [Lord's] purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth [regarded as conquered and put under tribute by Assyria]; and this is [His omnipotent] hand that is stretched out over all the nations.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>27 </span>For the Lord of hosts has purposed, and who can annul it? And His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>28 </span>In the year that King Ahaz died there came this mournful, inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up):</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>29 </span>Rejoice not, O Philistia, all of you, because the rod [of Judah] that smote you is broken; for out of the serpent's root shall come forth an adder [King Hezekiah of Judah], and its [the serpent's] offspring will be a fiery, flying serpent.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>30 </span>And the firstborn of the poor and the poorest of the poor [of Judah] shall feed on My meadows, and the needy will lie down in safety; but I will kill your root with famine, and your remnant shall be slain.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>31 </span>Howl, O gate! Cry, O city! Melt away, O Philistia, all of you! For there is coming a smoke out of the north, and there is no straggler in his ranks and none stands aloof [in Hezekiah's battalions].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>32 </span>What then shall one answer the messengers of the [Philistine] nation? That the Lord has founded Zion, and in her shall the poor and afflicted of His people trust and find refuge.</p>

                            <h5>Isaiah 15</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>The mournful, inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up) concerning Moab: Because in a night Ar of Moab is laid waste and brought to silence! Because in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste and brought to silence!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>They are gone up to Bayith and to Dibon, to the high places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba; on all their heads is baldness, and every beard is cut off [as a sign of deep sorrow and humiliation].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>In their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth; on their housetops and in their broad plazas everyone wails, weeping abundantly.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>And Heshbon and Elealeh [cities in possession of Moab] cry out; their voice is heard even to Jahaz. Therefore the armed soldiers of Moab cry out; [Moab's] life is grievous and trembles within him.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>My heart cries out for Moab; his nobles and other fugitives flee to Zoar, to Eglath-shelishiyah [like a heifer three years old]. For with weeping they go up the ascent of Luhith; for on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of destruction.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>For the waters of Nimrim are desolations, for the grass is withered away and the new growth fails; there is no green thing.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>Therefore the abundance [of possessions] they have acquired and stored away they [now] carry over the willow brook and to the valley of the Arabians.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>For the cry [of distress] has gone round the borders of Moab; the wailing has reached to Eglaim, and the prolonged and mournful cry to Beer-elim.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; yet I [the Lord] will bring even more upon Dimon—a lion upon those of Moab who escape and upon the remnant of the land.</p>

                            <h5>Isaiah 16</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>Send lambs to the ruler of the land from Sela [the rock city] through the desert and wilderness to the mountain of the Daughter of Zion [Jerusalem].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>For like wandering birds, like a brood cast out and a scattered nest, so shall the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the [river] Arnon.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>Give counsel, execute justice [for Moab, O king of Judah]; make your shade [over us] like night in the midst of noonday; hide the outcasts, betray not the fugitive to his pursuer.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>Let our outcasts of Moab dwell among you; be a sheltered hiding place to them from the destroyer. When the extortion and the extortioner have been brought to nought, and destruction has ceased, and the oppressors and they who trample men are consumed and have vanished from the land,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>Then in mercy and loving-kindness shall a throne be established, and One shall sit upon it in truth and faithfulness in the tent of David, judging and seeking justice and being swift to do righteousness.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>We have heard of the pride of Moab, that he is very proud—even of his arrogance, his pride, his wrath, his untruthful boasting.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>Therefore shall Moab wail for Moab; everyone shall wail. For the ruins, flagons of wine, and the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth you shall mourn, utterly stricken and discouraged.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>For the fields of Heshbon languish and wither, and the vines of Sibmah; the lords of the nations have broken down [Moab's] choice vine branches, which reached even to Jazer, wandering into the wilderness; its shoots stretched out abroad, they passed over [the shores of] the [Dead] Sea.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>Therefore I [Isaiah] will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vines of Sibmah. I will drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh; for upon your summer fruits and your harvest the shout [of alarm and the cry of the enemy] has fallen.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10 </span>And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there is no singing, nor is there joyful sound; the treaders tread out no wine in the presses, for the shout of joy has been made to cease.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11 </span>Wherefore my heart sounds like a harp [in mournful compassion] for Moab, and my inner being [goes out] for Kir-hareseth [for those brick-walled citadels of his].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12 </span>It shall be that when Moab presents himself, when he wearies himself [worshiping] on the high place [of idolatry], he will come to his sanctuary [of Chemosh, god of Moab], but he will not prevail. [Then will he be ashamed of his god.]</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13 </span>This is the word that the Lord has spoken concerning Moab since that time [when Moab's pride and resistance to God were first known].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14 </span>But now the Lord has spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of a hireling [who will not serve longer than the allotted time], the glory of Moab shall be brought into contempt, despite all his mighty multitudes of people; and the remnant that survives will be very small, feeble, and of no account.</p>

                            <h5>Isaiah 17</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>The mournful, inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up) concerning Damascus [capital of Syria, and Israel's bulwark against Assyria]. Behold, Damascus will cease to be a city and will become a heap of ruins.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>The cities of Aroer [east of the Jordan] are forsaken; they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>His bulwark [Syria] and the fortress shall disappear from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus; and the remnant of Syria will be like the [departed] glory of the children of Israel [her ally], says the Lord of hosts.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>And in that day the former glory of Jacob [Israel—his might, his population, his prosperity] shall be enfeebled, and the fat of his flesh shall become lean.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>And it shall be as when the reaper gathers the standing grain and his arm harvests the ears; yes, it shall be as when one gathers the ears of grain in the fertile Valley of Rephaim.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>Yet gleanings [of grapes] shall be left in it [the land of Israel], as after the beating of an olive tree [with a stick], two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outermost branches of the fruitful tree, says the Lord, the God of Israel.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>In that day will men look to their Maker, and their eyes shall regard the Holy One of Israel.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>And they will not look to the [idolatrous] altars, the work of their hands, neither will they have respect for what their fingers have made—either the Asherim [symbols of the goddess Asherah] or the sun-images.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>In that day will their [Syria's and Israel's] strong cities be like the forsaken places in the wood and on the mountaintop, as they [the Amorites and the Hivites] forsook their [cities] because of the children of Israel; and there will be desolation.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10 </span>Because you have forgotten the God of your salvation [O Judah] and have not been mindful of the Rock of your strength, your Stronghold—therefore, you have planted pleasant nursery grounds and plantings [to Adonis, pots of quickly withered flowers used to set by their doors or in the courts of temples], and have set [the grounds] with vine slips of a strange [God],</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11 </span>And in the day of your planting you hedge it in, and in the morning you make your seed to blossom, yet [promising as it is] the harvest shall be a heap of ruins and flee away in the day of expected possession and of desperate sorrow and sickening, incurable pain.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12 </span>Ah, the uproar of many peoples who roar like the roaring of the seas! And the rushing of nations that rush like the rushing of mighty waters—</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13 </span>The nations will rush and roar like the rushing and roaring of many waters—but [God] will rebuke them, and they will flee far off and will be chased like chaff on the mountains before the wind, and like rolling thistledown or whirling dust of the storm before the tempest.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14 </span>At evening time, behold, terror! And before the morning, they [the terrorizing Assyrians] are not. This is the portion of those who strip us [the Jews] of what belongs to us, and the lot of those who rob us.</p>                                                </div>

                            <h5>Isaiah 18</h5>

                            <h5>Isaiah 18</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span>Woe to the land whirring with wings which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span>Which sends ambassadors by the Nile, even in vessels of papyrus upon the waters! Go, you swift messengers, to a nation tall and polished, to a people terrible from their beginning [feared and dreaded near and far], a nation strong and victorious, whose land the rivers divide!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span>All you inhabitants of the world, you who dwell on the earth, when a signal is raised on the mountains—look! When a trumpet is blown—hear!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span>For thus the Lord has said to me: I will be still and I will look on from My dwelling place, like clear and glowing heat in sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span>For before the harvest, when the blossom is over and the flower becomes a ripening grape, He will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and the spreading branches He will remove and cut away.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span>They [the dead bodies of the slain warriors] shall be left together to the ravenous birds of the mountains and to the beasts of the earth; and the ravenous birds will summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth will winter upon them.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span>At that time shall a present be brought to the Lord of hosts from a people tall and polished, from a people terrible from their beginning and feared and dreaded near and far, a nation strong and victorious, whose land the rivers divide—to the place [of worship] of the Name of the Lord of hosts, to Mount Zion [in Jerusalem].</p>

                            <h5>Isaiah 19</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span>The burden or oracle concerning Egypt: Behold, the Lord is riding on a swift cloud and comes to Egypt; and the idols of Egypt will tremble at His presence, and the hearts of the Egyptians will melt within them.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span>And I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians, and they will fight, every one against his brother and every one against his neighbor, city against city, kingdom against kingdom.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span>And the spirit of the Egyptians within them will become exhausted and emptied out, and their counsel and wisdom will be swallowed up; and they will seek counsel from the idols and the sorcerers, and from those having familiar spirits (the mediums) and the wizards.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span>And I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a hard and cruel master, and a fierce king will rule over them, says the Lord, the Lord of hosts.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span>And the waters shall fail from the Nile, and the river shall be wasted and become dry.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span>And the rivers shall become foul, the streams and canals of Egypt shall be diminished and dried up, the reeds and the rushes shall wither and rot away.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span>The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the Nile shall become dry, be blown away, and be no more.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span>The fishermen will lament, and all who cast a hook into the Nile will mourn; and they who spread nets upon the waters will languish.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span>Moreover, they who work with combed flax and they who weave white [cotton] cloth will be confounded and in despair.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span>[Those who are] the pillars and foundations of Egypt will be crushed, and all those who work for hire or who build dams will be grieved.</p>

                            <h5>Isaiah 20</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span>In the year that the Tartan [Assyrian commander in chief] came to Ashdod in Philistia, sent by Sargon king of Assyria, he fought against Ashdod and took it.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span>At that time the Lord spoke by Isaiah son of Amoz, saying, Go, loose the sackcloth from off your loins and take your shoes off your feet. And he had done so, walking around stripped [to his loincloth] and barefoot.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span>And the Lord said, As My servant Isaiah has walked [comparatively] naked and barefoot for three years, as a sign and forewarning concerning Egypt and concerning Ethiopia,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span>So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptian captives and the Ethiopian exiles, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with buttocks uncovered—to the shame of Egypt.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span>And they shall be dismayed and confounded because of Ethiopia their hope and expectation and Egypt their glory and boast.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span>And the inhabitants of this coastland [the Israelites and their neighbors] will say in that day, See! This is what comes to those in whom we trusted and hoped, to whom we fled for help to deliver us from the king of Assyria! But we, how shall we escape [captivity and exile]?</p>

                            <h5>Isaiah 21</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span>The burden or oracle (the thing to be lifted up) concerning the Desert of the Sea [which was Babylon after great dams were raised to control the waters of the Euphrates River which overflowed it like a sea—and would do so again]: As whirlwinds in the South (the Negeb) sweep through, so it [the judgment of God by hostile armies] comes from the desert, from a terrible land.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span>A hard and grievous vision is declared to me: the treacherous dealer deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, O Elam! Besiege, O Media! All the sighing [caused by Babylon's ruthless oppressions] I will cause to cease [says the Lord].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span>Therefore are my [Isaiah's] loins filled with anguish, pangs have seized me like the pangs of a woman in childbirth; I am bent and pained so that I cannot hear, I am dismayed so that I cannot see.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span>My mind reels and wanders, horror terrifies me. [In my mind's eye I am at the feast of Belshazzar. I see the defilement of the golden vessels taken from God's temple, I watch the handwriting appear on the wall—I know that Babylon's great king is to be slain.] The twilight I looked forward to with pleasure has been turned into fear and trembling for me.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span>They prepare the table, they spread the rugs, they eat, they drink. Arise, you princes, and oil your shields [for your deadly foe is at hand]!</p>

                            <h5>Isaiah 22</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span>The burden or oracle (the thing to be lifted up) concerning the Valley of Vision: What do you mean [I wonder] that you have all gone up to the housetops,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span>You who are full of shouting, a tumultuous city, a joyous and exultant city? [O Jerusalem] your slain warriors have not met [a glorious] death with the sword or in battle.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span>All your rulers have fled together, without the bow [which they had not courage to use against the enemy]; all of you who were found were bound together [as captives], though they had fled far away.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span>Therefore I [Isaiah] said, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly. Do not hasten and try to comfort me over the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span>For it is a day of discomfiture and of tumult, of treading down, of confusion and perplexity from the Lord God of hosts in the Valley of Vision, a day of breaking down the walls and of crying to the mountains.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span>And [in my vision I saw] Elam take up the quiver, with troops in chariots, infantry, and horsemen; and Kir [with Elam subject to Assyria] uncovered the shield.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span>And it came to pass that your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen took their station [and set themselves in offensive array] at the gate.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span>Then [God] removed the protective covering of Judah; and you looked to the weapons in the House of the Forest [the king's armory] in that day.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span>You saw that the breaches [in the walls] of the City of David [the citadel of Zion] were many; [since the water supply was still defective] you collected [within the city's walls] the waters of the Lower Pool.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span>And you numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses [to get materials] to fortify the [city] wall.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span>You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the Old Pool, but you did not look to its Maker, nor did you recognize Him Who planned it long ago.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span>And in that day the Lord God of hosts called you to weeping and mourning, to the shaving off of all your hair [in humiliation] and to the girding with sackcloth.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span>But instead, see the pleasure and mirth, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine, [with the idea] Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span>And the Lord of hosts revealed Himself in my ears [as He said], Surely this unatoned sin shall not be purged from you until [you are punished—and the punishment will be] death, says the Lord God of hosts.</p>

                            <h2>1 Timothy 4</h2>
                            <h5>1 Timothy 4</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span>But the [Holy] Spirit distinctly and expressly declares that in latter times some will turn away from the faith, giving attention to deluding and seducing spirits and doctrines that demons teach,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span>Through the hypocrisy and pretensions of liars whose consciences are seared (cauterized),</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span>Who forbid people to marry and [teach them] to abstain from [certain kinds of] foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and have [an increasingly clear] knowledge of the truth.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span>For everything God has created is good, and nothing is to be thrown away or refused if it is received with thanksgiving.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span>For it is hallowed and consecrated by the Word of God and by prayer.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span>If you lay all these instructions before the brethren, you will be a worthy steward and a good minister of Christ Jesus, ever nourishing your own self on the truths of the faith and of the good [Christian] instruction which you have closely followed.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span>But refuse and avoid irreverent legends (profane and impure and godless fictions, mere grandmothers' tales) and silly myths, and express your disapproval of them. Train yourself toward godliness (piety), [keeping yourself spiritually fit].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span>For physical training is of some value (useful for a little), but godliness (spiritual training) is useful and of value in everything and in every way, for it holds promise for the present life and also for the life which is to come.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span>This saying is reliable and worthy of complete acceptance by everybody.</p>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span>Continue to command these things and to teach them.</p>

                            <h2>Isaiah 22:15 - 25:12</h2>

                            <h5>Isaiah 22:15-25</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>15 </span>Thus says the Lord God of hosts: Go, get you to this [contemptible] steward and treasurer, to Shebna, who is over the house [but who is presumptuous enough to be building himself a tomb among those of the mighty, a tomb worthy of a king], and say to him,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16 </span>What business have you here? And whom have you entombed here, that you have the right to hew out for yourself a tomb here? He hews out a sepulcher for himself on the height! He carves out a dwelling for himself in the rock!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17 </span>Behold, the Lord will hurl you away violently, O you strong man; yes, He will take tight hold of you and He will surely cover you [with shame].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18 </span>He will surely roll you up in a bundle [Shebna] and toss you like a ball into a large country; there you will die and there will be your splendid chariots, you disgrace to your master's house!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19 </span>And I will thrust you from your office, and from your station will you be pulled down.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20 </span>And in that day I will call My servant Eliakim son of Hilkiah.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21 </span>And I will clothe him with your robe and will bind your girdle on him and will commit your authority to his hand; he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22 </span>And the key of the house of David I will lay upon his shoulder; he shall open and no one shall shut, he shall shut and no one shall open.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>23 </span>And I will fasten him like a peg or nail in a firm place; and he will become a throne of honor and glory to his father's house.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>24 </span>And they will hang on him all the honor and glory of his father's house: the offspring and issue [of the family], all the small vessels, from the cups even to all the flasks and big bulging bottles.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>25 </span>In that day, says the Lord of hosts, the nail or peg that was fastened into the sure place shall give way and be moved and be hewn down and fall, and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off; for the Lord has spoken it.</p>

                            <h5>Isaiah 23</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>The mournful, inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up) concerning Tyre: Wail, you ships of [Tyre returning from trading with] Tarshish, for Tyre is laid waste, so that there is no house, no harbor; from the land of Kittim (Cyprus) they learn of it.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>Be still, you inhabitants of the coast, you merchants of Sidon, your messengers passing over the sea have replenished you [with wealth and industry],</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>And were on great waters. The seed or grain of the Shihor, the harvest [due to the overflow] of the Nile River, was [Tyre's] revenue, and she was the market of nations.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>Be ashamed, O Sidon [mother-city of Tyre, now a widow bereaved of her children], for the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, I have neither travailed nor brought forth children; I have neither nourished and reared young men nor brought up virgins.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>When the report comes to Egypt, they will be sorely pained over the report about Tyre.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>Pass over to Tarshish [to seek safety as exiles]! Wail, you inhabitants of the [Tyre] coast!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>Is this your jubilant city, whose origin dates from antiquity, whose own feet carried her far off to settle [colonies]?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>Who has purposed this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants were princes, whose traders were the honored of the earth?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>The Lord of hosts has purposed it [in accordance with a fixed principle of His government], to defile the pride of all glory and to bring into dishonor and contempt all the honored of the earth.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10 </span>Overflow your land like [the overflow of] the Nile River, O Daughter of Tarshish; there is no girdle of restraint [on you] any more [to make you pay tribute or customs or duties to Tyre].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11 </span>He stretched out His hand over the sea, He shook the kingdoms; the Lord has given a command concerning Canaan to destroy her strongholds and fortresses [Tyre, Sidon, etc.].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12 </span>And He said, You shall no more exult, you oppressed and crushed one, O Virgin Daughter of Sidon. Arise, pass over to Kittim (Cyprus); but even there you will have no rest.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13 </span>Look at the land of the Chaldeans! That people and not the Assyrians designed and assigned [Tyre] for the wild beasts and those who [previously] dwelt in the wilderness. They set up their siege works, they overthrew its palaces, they made it a ruin!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14 </span>Wail, you ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold [of Tyre] is destroyed!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15 </span>And in that day Tyre will be in obscurity and forgotten for seventy years, according to the days of one dynasty. After the end of seventy years will Tyre sing as a harlot [who has been forgotten but again attracts her lovers].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16 </span>Take a harp, go about the city, O forgotten harlot; play skillfully and make sweet melody, sing many songs, that you may be remembered.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17 </span>And after the end of seventy years the Lord will remember Tyre; and she will return to her hire [as a prostitute] and will play the harlot with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18 </span>But her gain and her hire [the profits of Tyre's new prosperity] will be dedicated to the Lord [eventually]; it will not be treasured or stored up, for her gain will be used for those who dwell in the presence of the Lord [the ministers], that they may eat sufficiently and have durable and stately clothing [suitable for those who minister at God's altar].</p>

                            <h5>Isaiah 24</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>Behold, the Lord will make the land and the earth empty and make it waste and turn it upside down (twist the face of it) and scatter abroad its inhabitants.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>And it shall be—as [what happens] with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the creditor, so with the debtor.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>The land and the earth shall be utterly laid waste and utterly pillaged; for the Lord has said this.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>The land and the earth mourn and wither, the world languishes and withers, the high ones of the people [and the heavens with the earth] languish.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>The land and the earth also are defiled by their inhabitants, because they have transgressed the laws, disregarded the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>Therefore a curse devours the land and the earth, and they who dwell in it suffer the punishment of their guilt. Therefore the inhabitants of the land and the earth are scorched and parched [under the curse of God's wrath], and few people are left.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>The new wine mourns, the vine languishes; all the merrymakers sigh.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>The mirth of the timbrels is stilled, the noise of those who rejoice ends, the joy of the lyre is stopped.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>No more do they drink wine with a song; strong drink is bitter to those who drink it.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10 </span>The city of confusion and chaos is broken down; every house is shut up so that no one may enter.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11 </span>There is crying in the streets for wine; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is banished and gone into captivity.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12 </span>In the city is left desolation, and its gate is battered and destroyed.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13 </span>For so shall it be in the midst of the earth among the peoples, as the shaking and beating of an olive tree, or as the gleaning when the vintage is done [and only a small amount of the fruit remains].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14 </span>[But] these [who have escaped and remain] lift up their voices, they shout; for the majesty of the Lord they cry aloud from the [Mediterranean] Sea.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15 </span>Wherefore glorify the Lord in the east [whether in the region of daybreak's lights and fires, or in the west]; [glorify] the name of the Lord, the God of Israel in the isles and coasts of the [Mediterranean] Sea.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16 </span>From the uttermost parts of the earth have we heard songs: Glory to the Righteous One [and to the people of Israel]! But I say, Emaciated I pine away, I pine away. Woe is me! The treacherous dealers deal treacherously! Yes, the treacherous dealers deal very treacherously.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17 </span>Terror and pit [of destruction] and snare are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18 </span>And he who flees at the noise of the terror shall fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the pit shall be caught in the snare. For the windows of the heavens are opened [as in the deluge], and the foundations of the earth tremble and shake.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19 </span>The earth is utterly broken, the earth is rent asunder, the earth is shaken violently.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20 </span>The earth shall stagger like a drunken man and shall sway to and fro like a hammock; its transgression shall lie heavily upon it, and it shall fall and not rise again.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21 </span>And in that day the Lord will visit and punish the host of the high ones on high [the host of heaven in heaven, celestial beings] and the kings of the earth on the earth.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22 </span>And they will be gathered together as prisoners are gathered in a pit or dungeon; they will be shut up in prison, and after many days they will be visited, inspected, and punished or pardoned.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>23 </span>Then the moon will be confounded and the sun ashamed, when [they compare their ineffectual fire to the light of] the Lord of hosts, Who will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before His elders will show forth His glory.</p>

                            <h5>Isaiah 25</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>O Lord, You are my God; I will exalt You, I will praise Your name, for You have done wonderful things, even purposes planned of old [and fulfilled] in faithfulness and truth.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>For You have made a city a heap, a fortified city a ruin, a palace of aliens without a city [is no more a city]; it will never be rebuilt.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>Therefore [many] a strong people will glorify You, [many] a city of terrible and ruthless nations will [reverently] fear You.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>For You have been a stronghold for the poor, a stronghold for the needy in his distress, a shelter from the storm, a shade from the heat; for the blast of the ruthless ones is like a rainstorm against a wall.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>As the heat in a dry land [is reduced by the shadow of a cloud, so] You will bring down the noise of aliens [exultant over their enemies]; and as the heat is brought low by the shadow of a cloud, so the song of the ruthless ones is brought low.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>And on this Mount [Zion] shall the Lord of hosts make for all peoples a feast of rich things [symbolic of His coronation festival inaugurating the reign of the Lord on earth, in the wake of a unified Israel], a feast of wines on the lees—of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>And He will destroy on this mountain the covering of the face that is cast over the heads of all peoples [in mourning], and the veil [of profound wretchedness] that is woven and spread over all nations.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>He will swallow up death [in victory; He will abolish death forever]. And the Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces; and the reproach of His people He will take away from off all the earth; for the Lord has spoken it.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>It shall be said in that day, Behold our God upon Whom we have waited and hoped, that He might save us! This is the Lord, we have waited for Him; we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10 </span>For the hand of the Lord shall rest on this Mount [Zion], and Moab shall be threshed and trodden down in his place as straw is trodden down in the [filthy] water of a [primitive] cesspool.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11 </span>And though [Moab] stretches forth his hands in the midst of [the filthy water] as a swimmer stretches out his hands to swim, the Lord will bring down [Moab's] pride in spite of the skillfulness of his hands and together with the spoils of his hands.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12 </span>And the high fortifications of your walls [the Lord] will bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.</p>                                                </div>

                            <h2>1 Timothy 5</h2>
                            <h5>1 Timothy 5</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1 </span>Do not sharply rebuke an older man, but entreat and plead with him as [you would with] a father. Treat younger men like brothers;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2 </span>Treat older women like mothers [and] younger women like sisters, in all purity.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3 </span>Honor widows who are widows indeed [support them, discharging your duty toward them];</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4 </span>But if a widow has children or grandchildren, see to it that these are first made to understand that it is their religious duty [to defray their natural obligation to those] at home, and make return to their parents or grandparents [for all their care by contributing to their maintenance], for this is acceptable in the sight of God.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5 </span>Now [a woman] who is a real widow and is left entirely alone and desolate has fixed her hope on God and perseveres in supplications and prayers night and day,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6 </span>Whereas she who lives in pleasure and self-gratification [giving herself up to luxury and self-indulgence] is dead even while she [still] lives.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7 </span>Charge [the people] thus, so that they may be without reproach and blameless.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8 </span>If anyone fails to provide for his relatives, and especially for those of his own family, he has disowned the faith [by failing to accompany it with fruits] and is worse than an unbeliever [who performs his obligation in these matters].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9 </span>Let no one be put on the roll of widows [who are to receive church support] who is under sixty years of age or who has been the wife of more than one man;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10 </span>And she must have a reputation for good deeds, as one who has brought up children, who has practiced hospitality to strangers [of the brotherhood], washed the feet of the saints, helped to relieve the distressed, [and] devoted herself diligently to doing good in every way.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11 </span>But refuse [to enroll on this list the] younger widows, for when they become restive and their natural desires grow strong, they withdraw themselves against Christ [and] wish to marry [again].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12 </span>And so they incur condemnation for having set aside and slighted their previous pledge.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13 </span>Moreover, as they go about from house to house, they learn to be idlers, and not only idlers, but gossips and busybodies, saying what they should not say and talking of things they should not mention.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14 </span>So I would have younger [widows] marry, bear children, guide the household, [and] not give opponents of the faith occasion for slander or reproach.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15 </span>For already some [widows] have turned aside after Satan.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16 </span>If any believing woman or believing man has [relatives or persons in the household who are] widows, let him relieve them; let the church not be burdened [with them], so that it may [be free to] assist those who are truly widows (those who are all alone and are dependent).</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17 </span>Let the elders who perform the duties of their office well be considered doubly worthy of honor [and of adequate financial support], especially those who labor faithfully in preaching and teaching.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18 </span>For the Scripture says, You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain, and again, The laborer is worthy of his hire.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19 </span>Listen to no accusation [presented before a judge] against an elder unless it is confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20 </span>As for those who are guilty and persist in sin, rebuke and admonish them in the presence of all, so that the rest may be warned and stand in wholesome awe and fear.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21 </span>I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the chosen angels that you guard and keep [these rules] without personal prejudice or favor, doing nothing from partiality.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22 </span>Do not be in a hurry in the laying on of hands [giving the sanction of the church too hastily in reinstating expelled offenders or in ordination in questionable cases], nor share or participate in another man's sins; keep yourself pure.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>23 </span>Drink water no longer exclusively, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent illnesses.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>24 </span>The sins of some men are conspicuous (openly evident to all eyes), going before them to the judgment [seat] and proclaiming their sentence in advance; but the sins of others appear later [following the offender to the bar of judgment and coming into view there].</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>25 </span>So also, good deeds are evident and conspicuous, and even when they are not, they cannot remain hidden [indefinitely].</p>

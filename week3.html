                            <h2>Ecclesiastes 7:13 - 10:7</h2>

                            <h5>Ecclesiastes 7:13-29</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight,
                                which he hath
                                made crooked?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of
                                adversity consider:
                                God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find
                                nothing after him.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a
                                just man that
                                perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in
                                his wickedness.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16</span> Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise:
                                why shouldest
                                thou destroy thyself?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why
                                shouldest thou die
                                before thy time?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18</span> It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also
                                from this
                                withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19</span> Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which
                                are in the
                                city.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20</span> For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and
                                sinneth not.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21</span> Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou
                                hear thy
                                servant curse thee:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22</span> For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself
                                likewise
                                hast cursed others.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>23</span> All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but
                                it was far
                                from me.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>24</span> That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it
                                out?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>25</span> I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out
                                wisdom, and
                                the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and
                                madness:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>26</span> And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is
                                snares and
                                nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner
                                shall be taken by her.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>27</span> Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one
                                by one, to
                                find out the account:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>28</span> Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a
                                thousand have I
                                found; but a woman among all those have I not found.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>29</span> Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright;
                                but they have sought out many
                                inventions.</p>


                            <h5>Ecclesiastes 8</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of
                                a thing? a man's wisdom
                                maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in
                                regard of the oath of God.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil
                                thing; for he doeth whatsoever
                                pleaseth him.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say
                                unto him, What doest thou?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a
                                wise man's heart discerneth
                                both time and judgment.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore
                                the misery of man is great
                                upon him.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him
                                when it shall be?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the
                                spirit; neither hath he
                                power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall
                                wickedness
                                deliver those that are given to it.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work
                                that is done under the sun:
                                there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from
                                the place of the holy, and
                                they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Because sentence against an evil work is not executed
                                speedily, therefore the heart of
                                the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be
                                prolonged, yet surely I know
                                that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he
                                prolong his days, which are as
                                a shadow; because he feareth not before God.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be
                                just men, unto whom it
                                happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it
                                happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing
                                under the sun, than to eat,
                                and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of
                                his
                                life, which God giveth him under the sun.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16</span> When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the
                                business that is done upon the
                                earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out
                                the work that is done under
                                the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea
                                further;
                                though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.</p>

                            <h5>Ecclesiastes 9</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all
                                this, that the righteous, and
                                the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred
                                by
                                all that is before them.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> All things come alike to all: there is one event to the
                                righteous, and to the wicked; to
                                the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that
                                sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that
                                feareth
                                an oath.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun,
                                that there is one event unto
                                all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their
                                heart
                                while they live, and after that they go to the dead.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for
                                a living dog is better than
                                a dead lion.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not
                                any thing, neither have
                                they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now
                                perished; neither have they any
                                more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a
                                merry heart; for God now
                                accepteth thy works.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no
                                ointment.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of
                                the life of thy vanity, which
                                he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in
                                this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for
                                there is no work, nor
                                device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to
                                the swift, nor the battle to
                                the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor
                                yet
                                favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are
                                taken in an evil net, and as
                                the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time,
                                when
                                it falleth suddenly upon them.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed
                                great unto me:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> There was a little city, and few men within it; and there
                                came a great king against it,
                                and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his
                                wisdom delivered the city; yet
                                no man remembered that same poor man.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16</span> Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the
                                poor man's wisdom is
                                despised, and his words are not heard.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of
                                him that ruleth among
                                fools.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18</span> Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner
                                destroyeth much good.</p>

                            <h5>Ecclesiastes 10:1-7</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth
                                a stinking savour: so doth a
                                little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at
                                his left.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his
                                wisdom faileth him, and he saith
                                to every one that he is a fool.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy
                                place; for yielding
                                pacifieth great offences.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error
                                which proceedeth from the
                                ruler:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as
                                servants upon the earth.</p>

                            <h2>1 Thessalonians 5</h2>
                            <h5>1 Thessalonians 5</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need
                                that I write unto you.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so
                                cometh as a thief in the night.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden
                                destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not
                                escape.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
                                overtake you as a thief.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day:
                                we are not of the night, nor of darkness.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and
                                be sober.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be
                                drunken are drunken in the night.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the
                                breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain
                                salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should
                                live together with him.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another,
                                even as also ye do.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among
                                you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake.
                                And be at peace among yourselves.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly,
                                comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever
                                follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> Rejoice evermore.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16</span> Pray without ceasing.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in
                                Christ Jesus concerning you.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18</span> Quench not the Spirit.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19</span> Despise not prophesyings.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20</span> Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21</span> Abstain from all appearance of evil.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22</span> And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God
                                your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord
                                Jesus Christ.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>23</span> Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>24</span> Brethren, pray for us.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>25</span> Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>26</span> I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all
                                the holy brethren.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>27</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. (The
                                first epistle to the Thessalonians was written from Athens.)</p>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh
                                an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that
                                cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.</p>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles,
                                and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18</span> By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through
                                idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19</span> A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but
                                money answereth all things.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20</span> Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the
                                rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath
                                wings shall tell the matter.</p>

                            <h5>Ecclesiastes 11</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after
                                many days.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest
                                not what evil shall be upon the earth.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the
                                earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where
                                the tree falleth, there it shall be.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that
                                regardeth the clouds shall not reap.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the
                                bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works
                                of God who maketh all.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not
                                thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether
                                they both shall be alike good.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the
                                eyes to behold the sun:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let
                                him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer
                                thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of
                                thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil
                                from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.</p>

                            <h5>Ecclesiastes 12</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the
                                evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in
                                them;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not
                                darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and
                                the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and
                                those that look out of the windows be darkened,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of
                                the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the
                                daughters of musick shall be brought low;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and
                                fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall
                                be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners
                                go about the streets:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be
                                broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the
                                spirit shall return unto God who gave it.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught
                                the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many
                                proverbs.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that
                                which was written was upright, even words of truth.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by
                                the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many
                                books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and
                                keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every
                                secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</p>

                            <h5>Song of Solomon 1</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> The song of songs, which is Solomon's.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is
                                better than wine.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as
                                ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into
                                his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than
                                wine: the upright love thee.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the
                                tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath
                                looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the
                                vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where
                                thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by
                                the flocks of thy companions?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth
                                by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in
                                Pharaoh's chariots.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with
                                chains of gold.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth
                                forth the smell thereof.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> A bundle of myrrh is my wellbeloved unto me; he shall lie all
                                night betwixt my breasts.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the
                                vineyards of Engedi.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou
                                hast doves' eyes.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16</span> Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our
                                bed is green.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.</p>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my
                                beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit
                                was sweet to my taste.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me

                            <h5>2 Thessalonians 1</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
                                Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord
                                Jesus Christ.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is
                                meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you
                                all toward each other aboundeth;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for
                                your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God,
                                that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense
                                tribulation to them that trouble you;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus
                                shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God,
                                and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the
                                presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be
                                admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that
                                day.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would
                                count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and
                                the work of faith with power:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in
                                you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I
                                sought
                                him, but I

                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets,

                                ways I will seek him whom my soul
                                loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom
                                I said,
                                Saw ye him
                                whom my soul loveth?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> It was but a little that I passed from them, but I

                                loveth: I held him, and would not
                                let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber
                                of her
                                that

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have
                                gathered my myrrh
                                with my spice; I have eaten my
                                honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends;
                                drink, yea,

                                the drops
                                of the

                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have

                                my feet; how
                                shall I defile them?</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door,

                                moved for him.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped
                                with
                                myrrh, and my

                                gone: my soul failed when he spake: I
                                sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> The watchmen that went about the city found me, they

                                wounded me; the keepers of the walls took
                                away my veil from me.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my

                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his

                                as bright
                                ivory overlaid with sapphires.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets
                                of fine

                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being
                                bound in affliction and iron;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned
                                the counsel of the most High:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell
                                down, and there was none to help.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved
                                them out of their distresses.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and
                                brake their bands in sunder.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
                                his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16</span> For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of
                                iron in sunder.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> Fools because of their transgression, and because of their
                                iniquities, are afflicted.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18</span> Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near
                                unto the gates of death.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19</span> Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth
                                them out of their distresses.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20</span> He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from
                                their destructions.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21</span> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
                                his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22</span> And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and
                                declare his works with rejoicing.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>23</span> They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in
                                great waters;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>24</span> These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>25</span> For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth
                                up the waves thereof.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>26</span> They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the
                                depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>27</span> They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are
                                at their wits' end.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>28</span> Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth
                                them out of their distresses.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>29</span> He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are
                                still.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>30</span> Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them
                                unto their desired haven.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>31</span> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
                                his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>32</span> Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people,
                                and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>33</span> He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings
                                into dry ground;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>34</span> A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them
                                that dwell therein.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>35</span> He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry
                                ground into watersprings.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>36</span> And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may
                                prepare a city for habitation;</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>37</span> And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield
                                fruits of increase.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>38</span> He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
                                and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>39</span> Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression,
                                affliction, and sorrow.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>40</span> He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander
                                in the wilderness, where there is no way.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>41</span> Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh
                                him families like a flock.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>42</span> The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity
                                shall stop her mouth.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>43</span> Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall
                                understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.</p>


                            <h5>Proverbs 23: 1-28</h5>

                            <p class="fnb"><span>1</span> When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently
                                what is before thee:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>2</span> And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to
                                appetite.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>3</span> Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>4</span> Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>5</span> Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches
                                certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>6</span> Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither
                                desire thou his dainty meats:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>7</span> For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink,
                                saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>8</span> The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose
                                thy sweet words.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>9</span> Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the
                                wisdom of thy words.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>10</span> Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of
                                the fatherless:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>11</span> For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with
                                thee.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>12</span> Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the
                                words of knowledge.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>13</span> Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest
                                him with the rod, he shall not die.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>14</span> Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul
                                from hell.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>15</span> My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even
                                mine.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>16</span> Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right
                                things.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>17</span> Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of
                                the LORD all the day long.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>18</span> For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not
                                be cut off.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>19</span> Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the
                                way.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>20</span> Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>21</span> For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and
                                drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>22</span> Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy
                                mother when she is old.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>23</span> Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction,
                                and understanding.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>24</span> The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he
                                that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>25</span> Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare
                                thee shall rejoice.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>26</span> My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my
                                ways.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>27</span> For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow
                                pit.</p>
                            <p class="fnb"><span>28</span> She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the
                                transgressors among men.</p>
